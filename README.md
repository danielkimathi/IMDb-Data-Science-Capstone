# IMDb-Data-Science-Capstone
IMDb Movie Ratings Prediction Capstone Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict IMDb movie ratings using machine learning models, including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees. By leveraging insights from movie-related features such as director ratings, runtime, and genre, this project demonstrates the power of feature engineering and model evaluation techniques.

The notebook contains:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights from the dataset.
Feature engineering to enhance model accuracy.
Training and evaluation of multiple machine learning models.
Conclusions and comparisons of the models' performance.
